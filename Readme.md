**Project description**
This project is about an app for learning Vocabulary. Basically, the app lets users make their own themes using vocabulary linked to a certain theme, which they can then study and practice with different kinds of tests and activities.

**Project Structure**:
n the source code folder, there are two directories: 'client_app' and 'server'. The client_app directory is a Flutter project and should be opened with Visual Studio Code. The 'server' is a REST API of Node.js and is included to demonstrate the server's operation.


**Running the Application**:
- Open your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- Navigate to the project directory and locate the `client_app`.
- Run the server in 'server' dicrectory (type 'npm install' then 'npm start')
- Start the application.

**Login Interface**:
Once the application has started, you will see two fields in the login interface: `Email` and `Password`.

You can also sign up in the sign-up interface to set your own email and password.
